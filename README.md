# Traffic Sign Detection and Prediction 
This commit adds a Python script that uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify traffic signs in an input image. The script first loads the pre-trained model using Keras, and then reads in an input image of a traffic sign. The image is preprocessed, and the model is used to predict the class of the traffic sign in the image. The predicted class is then converted to the corresponding sign name using a dictionary, and the name is displayed on the image using OpenCV. The image is displayed in a window for visualization, and the window waits for a key press to close.
